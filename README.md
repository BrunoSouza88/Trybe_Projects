# Trybe Projects

Trybe is a web development school with more than 1500 hours of training, distributed between content study, live classes, individual and group projects and development of socio-emotional skills. The school invests all the resources necessary for people to learn the technical skills of a developer in practice, working on projects with real challenges, and evolving their soft skills, in addition to offering connection to the job market and helping with hiring.

At Trybe student learns from basic HMTL, CSS to real practice JavaScript, frameworks such as React, as well agile software development, back-end solutions like Docker, SQL TypeScript, MongoDB etc. Every section ends with a project covering all subjects were learned throughout that period.

In this repository I will be pushing my projects done with all requirements and solutions to showcasing my evolution all over the course.

Each project will be placed in a new branch, with its own README. Any question can be send through my personal e-mail, I'll be glad to answer.
